PROJECT: "Love Over Coffee" - The Ultimate Liquid Motion Experience

ROLE: You are a Senior Creative Frontend Engineer (Awwwards/FWA level).
GOAL: Build a single-file, production-ready index.html that is visually stunning, fully responsive, and features a smart "Local AI" (Maggie) without using external API keys.

1. DESIGN VISUALS: "Liquid Deep Space"

Theme: Dark Mode (#050511 background).

Aesthetic: "Liquid Motion". Think of the 'Revocalize.ai' website.

Background: A continuous, smooth "Water Wave" animation (CSS/Canvas) flowing in the background. It must feel alive.

Glassmorphism: Heavy use of backdrop-filter: blur(20px) for all cards, navbar, and the AI drawer.

Font: 'Roboto' (Body) and a modern display font for Headers.

2. ASSETS (Use These EXACT Paths)

Icon: Icon/faverat.ico

Menu/Hero Images: menu-pichers/2023-09-03 (1).webp to (6).webp, 2023-09-03.png.

Gallery: Gallery/1.webp to 49.webp.

Videos: Vedio/1.mp4 to 5.mp4.

AI Background: AI-BACKGROUND/Ai.jpg.

3. CORE ANIMATION: The "Vertical Flow" Hero Section

REQUIREMENT: Use GSAP (GreenSock) to create a seamless product switcher.
Logic:

The Stage: Center screen shows one "Hero Item".

The Switch (Every 3.5s):

Exit: The Current Item slides DOWN and fades out (with motion blur).

Enter: The Next Item slides UP from the bottom to take the center spot.

Background: The liquid wave colors must smoothly transition to match the item (e.g., Brown -> Purple -> Red -> Green).

Sequence:

Item 1: Cold Coffee (menu-pichers/2023-09-03 (1).webp) -> Bg: Deep Coffee Brown.

Item 2: Pizza (menu-pichers/2023-09-03 (6).webp) -> Bg: Fiery Red/Orange.

Item 3: Mojito (menu-pichers/2023-09-03.png) -> Bg: Fresh Mint Green.

Item 4: Sandwich (menu-pichers/2023-09-03 (5).webp) -> Bg: Golden Yellow.

4. "MAGGIE" - THE LOCAL AI (No API Key)

Build a JavaScript-based Intent Engine that simulates an AI. It must process user text and reply intelligently using hardcoded data.

A. The Database (Hardcode this exact data):

const MENU_DB = {
  "Cappuccino": 160, "Espresso": 110, "Americano": 150, "Hot Chocolate": 180,
  "Cafe Frappe": 190, "Tiramisu Frappe": 240, "Dark Choco Frappe": 200, "Nutella Frappe": 300,
  "Cheese Margarita": 310, "Paneer Bhurji Pizza": 400, "Farm Fresh Pizza": 330,
  "Pesto Grilled Sandwich": 330, "Veg Club Sandwich": 260, "Tandoori Paneer Sandwich": 270,
  "Peri Peri Fries": 220, "Cheese Nachos": 270, "Pao Bhaji Fondue": 350,
  "Virgin Mojito": 170, "Blueberry Ice Tea": 200
};
