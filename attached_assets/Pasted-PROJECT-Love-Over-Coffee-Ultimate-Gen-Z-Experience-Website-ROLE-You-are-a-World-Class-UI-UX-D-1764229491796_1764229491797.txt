PROJECT: "Love Over Coffee" - Ultimate Gen-Z Experience Website

ROLE: You are a World-Class UI/UX Designer and Senior Frontend Engineer (Awwwards-winning level). Your goal is to build the most stunning, interactive, and functional coffee shop website imaginable.

CONTEXT: We are building a website for "Love Over Coffee" in Indore. It needs to be a "Gen-Z" style website: highly animated, dark-themed, premium, glossy, and interactive.

REFERENCE AESTHETIC (Critical):

Theme: Dark Mode Deep Space (Midnight Blues, Deep Purples, and Coffee Browns).

Vibe: "Liquid Motion". Think of the 'Revocalize.ai' website.

Background: I want a continuous, smooth "Water Wave" or "Liquid Smoke" animation flowing in the background of the AI Chat section and Hero section. It should look alive.

Glassmorphism: Heavy use of blurry, frosted glass (backdrop-filter: blur) for cards, buttons, and the navbar.

1. FILE STRUCTURE & ASSETS

You must use these EXACT paths for images. Do not change them.

Icon: Icon/faverat.ico

Menu Images: menu-pichers/2023-09-03 (1).webp through (6).webp and 2023-09-03.png.

Gallery Images: Gallery/1.webp through 49.webp.

Videos: Vedio/1.mp4 through 5.mp4.

AI Background: AI-BACKGROUND/Ai.jpg.

2. KEY SECTIONS & ANIMATIONS

A. The "WOW" Hero Section

Background: A stunning CSS/Canvas liquid wave animation (Purple/Blue/Gold gradients) that moves slowly.

Title: "Wake Up to Love Over Coffee" with a glowing text effect (neon).

Interaction: When the mouse moves, elements should slightly tilt (3D parallax effect).

B. The "Maggie" AI Assistant (The Core Feature)

This is the most important part. You must implement the "Maggie" AI Side Panel exactly as described below:

Trigger: A floating "Glass Button" in the bottom right corner. It should have a "breathing" glow animation. Text: "Ask Maggie ✨".

UI: When clicked, a side drawer slides in from the right (Glassmorphism style).

Background: Use AI-BACKGROUND/Ai.jpg but add a floating particle effect over it.

Logic: - API Key: Use this exact key hardcoded: AIzaSyDJfYpgl9W7FEMpUmnXjU9HnSi1A365lEY.

Voice: Auto-speak with a soft female voice. Include a Mute toggle icon.

Menu Data: Pre-load the AI with the full menu (Hot Coffee, Cold Coffee, Pizza, Pasta, Maggie, Sandwiches, Shakes, etc.).

Context: If I say "I'm heartbroken", she suggests chocolate. If "Date", she suggests sharing platters.

Input: Text input + Mic button (for voice command simulation).

C. Smart Menu (Carousel)

Use Swiper.js for a smooth, infinite loop slider.

Hover Effect: When hovering over a menu card, it should scale up, glow, and show the price/details in a slide-up animation.

D. Responsive Intelligence

Auto-Detect Device: - On Mobile: The layout shifts to a vertical stack, fonts resize for readability, and the "Ask Maggie" button becomes a thumb-friendly FAB (Floating Action Button).

On Desktop: Full wide layouts with parallax scrolling.

3. TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS (The Code)

Framework: HTML5, Tailwind CSS (via CDN), Vanilla JavaScript.

Libraries: - Swiper.js (for sliders).

Leaflet.js (for the map).

Lucide (for icons).

GSAP (GreenSock) -> USE THIS for the "Wow" animations (scroll triggers, entrance animations).

Performance: Lazy load images (loading="lazy").

4. DETAILED "MAGGIE" SYSTEM PROMPT (Inject this into the JS)

Use this exact system prompt for the AI logic:
"You are Maggie, the AI Waiter for 'Love Over Coffee Indore'. Address: PLOT NO 11, Scheme No 51. TONE: Warm, Gen-Z, Hinglish allowed. RULES: Keep answers under 40 words. If user mentions a mood (Breakup, Date, Work), suggest specific items. Suggest menu items like Cappuccino (130), Paneer Bhurji Pizza (360), etc."

OUTPUT INSTRUCTION:
Generate the complete, single-file index.html code that includes the CSS animations, the JS logic for Maggie, and the HTML structure. It should be ready to run and look absolutely mind-blowing.
