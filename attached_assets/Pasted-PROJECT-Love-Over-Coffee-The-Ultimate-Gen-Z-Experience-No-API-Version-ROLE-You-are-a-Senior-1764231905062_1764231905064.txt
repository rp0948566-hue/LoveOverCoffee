PROJECT: "Love Over Coffee" - The Ultimate Gen-Z Experience (No-API Version)

ROLE: You are a Senior Creative Developer (Awwwards/FWA level).
GOAL: Build a single-file, production-ready index.html that is visually mind-blowing, fully responsive, and features a "Local AI" that requires NO external API keys.

1. DESIGN SYSTEM & AESTHETIC

Theme: "Dark Mode Liquid Deep Space".

Colors: Background is Deep Midnight Blue (#050511). Accents are Neon Purple, Coffee Brown, and Gold.

Vibe: Fluid, glossy, high-end. Use backdrop-filter: blur(20px) extensively (Glassmorphism).

Font: 'Roboto' (Body) and a modern display font like 'Oswald' or 'Playfair Display' for Headers.

2. ASSET PATHS (Use EXACTLY these)

Menu Images: menu-pichers/2023-09-03 (1).webp to (6).webp, 2023-09-03.png.

Gallery: Gallery/1.webp to 49.webp.

Videos: Vedio/1.mp4 to 5.mp4.

AI Background: AI-BACKGROUND/Ai.jpg.

Icon: Icon/faverat.ico.

3. CORE ANIMATION: The "Liquid Switch" Hero Section

Technology: Use GSAP (GreenSock) for this.
Behavior:

The Stage: A central spotlight showcasing one "Hero Item" (e.g., Cold Coffee).

The Transition: Every 3.5 seconds:

The Current Item slides DOWN and fades out (motion blur effect).

The Next Item slides UP from the bottom to take center stage.

Background Sync: The liquid background gradient MUST change color to match the item (e.g., Brown for Coffee → Red for Pizza → Green for Mojito).

Items Sequence:

Slide 1: Cold Coffee (Img: menu-pichers/2023-09-03 (1).webp) -> Bg: Deep Brown/Cream.

Slide 2: Pizza (Img: menu-pichers/2023-09-03 (6).webp) -> Bg: Deep Red/Orange.

Slide 3: Mojito (Img: menu-pichers/2023-09-03.png) -> Bg: Fresh Green/Teal.

Slide 4: Sandwich (Img: menu-pichers/2023-09-03 (5).webp) -> Bg: Golden/Yellow.

4. THE "MAGGIE" LOCAL AI (The Brain)

CRITICAL: Do NOT use an API Key. Build a Rule-Based Intent Engine in JavaScript.
This allows the site to be hosted for free with unlimited users.

Logic (The Chatbot):
Create a function getMaggieResponse(text) that scans for keywords:

If text contains "price" + item name: Return the exact price from MENU_DB.

If text contains "sad", "breakup", "heartbroken": Return "Oh no! 🥺💔 A Dark Chocolate Frappe (₹200) is the best cure for a broken heart. Sweetness heals everything!"

If text contains "date", "girlfriend", "love": Return "Ooh, romantic! 💍✨ I recommend sharing a Paneer Bhurji Pizza (₹400) and two Cappuccinos. Perfect for couples!"

If text contains "menu": Return a neatly formatted list of categories (Coffee, Pizza, Shakes).

Default Fallback: "I'm Maggie! I know everything about Love Over Coffee. Ask me about prices, 'best pizza', or tell me your mood!"

UI Features:

Trigger: "Ask Maggie ✨" Glass Button in the Header (Navbar).
