3. CORE SECTIONS & ANIMATIONS

A. The "WOW" Hero Section (Vertical Switcher)

CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: Implement a GSAP-powered vertical carousel.

Visual: A central "Stage" showing one item at a time.

Animation Logic (The "Switch"):

Current Item (e.g., Cold Coffee) slides DOWN and fades out.

Next Item (e.g., Chocolate Shake) slides UP from the bottom to take center stage.

Background Transition: As the item switches, the liquid wave background color gently shifts (e.g., Brown → Purple → Red).

Items to Cycle: Cold Coffee, Chocolate Shake, Pizza, Fries, Brownie, Mojito, Sandwich.

B. The "Maggie" AI Assistant (Integrated)

Trigger Location: REMOVE the floating button from the bottom right. Place the "Ask Maggie ✨" button prominently in the Header / Navbar.

Interface: A glassmorphism side-drawer sliding from the right.

Background: Use AI-BACKGROUND/Ai.jpg.

Functionality:

API Key: AIzaSyDJfYpgl9W7FEMpUmnXjU9HnSi1A365lEY (Hardcoded).

Voice: Auto-speak (Female voice). Mute toggle included.

Intelligence: Full menu knowledge. Context aware.

C. Smart Sections

Menu: Horizontal scroll with snap effect (Swiper.js). Cards glow on hover.

Gallery: Masonry or Grid layout that adjusts to mobile (1 column) vs desktop (3 columns).

Location Map: Leaflet.js map with a "Get Directions" button.
